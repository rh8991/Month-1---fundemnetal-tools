# 📊 Signal Processing Learning Path (6 Months)

Welcome to my 6-month journey through the world of **Signal Processing**. This repository contains a project for each month, highlighting the skills learned and tools used in real-time audio, biomedical signals, and machine learning applications.

---

## 🗓️ Month 1: Signal Generator App

Builds a strong foundation in signal theory and basic tools.

### ✅ Project: `signal-generator-app`

- Generate sine, square, and sawtooth waves
- Visualize them using Matplotlib
- Optional: Add GUI (Python or MATLAB)

---

## 🗓️ Month 2: Audio Noise Filter

Applies transforms and filtering concepts to clean real-world audio.

### ✅ Project: `SonicScope`

- Record a noisy audio clip
- Design FIR/IIR filters (e.g., Butterworth)
- Filter and compare signals before and after

---

## 🗓️ Month 3: ECG Filter & Anomaly Detector

Works with real biomedical data and introduces simulation tools.

### ✅ Project: `ecg-anomaly-detector`

- Load ECG signals (from PhysioNet)
- Filter noise, detect peaks
- Optional: Identify irregular heartbeats

---

## 🗓️ Month 4: Real-Time DSP on Microcontroller

Bridges embedded systems and DSP for real-time filtering.

### ✅ Project: `arduino-dsp-filter`

- Capture audio via mic on Arduino
- Implement basic low-pass or band-stop filters in C
- Output processed signal to speaker

---

## 🗓️ Month 5: Voice Command Classifier

Combines signal processing with machine learning.

### ✅ Project: `voice-command-classifier`

- Record voice commands
- Extract features (FFT, energy, etc.)
- Train an ML model (e.g., SVM or KNN)

---

## 🗓️ Month 6: Final Project & Portfolio

Brings everything together into a showcase-worthy application.

### ✅ Project Options (folder: `final-project`)

- 🎛️ Real-time DSP GUI (e.g., FFT visualizer)
- ❤️ Biomedical signal processor
- 🤖 ML-powered sound/motion detector
