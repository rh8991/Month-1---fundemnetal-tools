# 🎛️ Signal Generator Project — One Month Build

This project is a Python-based Signal Generator built over the course of one month. It allows users to generate, visualize, and play various types of signals (sine, square) through a user-friendly GUI.

---

## 📅 Timeline

### 🗓️ Month 1 — Initial Build

**Goals:**
- Learn basics of signal generation and GUI design
- Implement a working signal generator with visualization and sound playback
- Practice modular Python development

**What’s Included:**
- Modular Python code for signal generation
- Matplotlib-based plotting
- Audio playback with `sounddevice`
- GUI built using `tkinter` for simplicity and portability
- Clean README, LICENSE, and project structure

---

## 🔍 Features

- 🎵 Generate sine, square and triangle waves
- ✏️ Customize frequency, amplitude, and duration
- 🖼 Visual waveform display using Matplotlib
- 🔊 Play signal through your system speakers
- 🧩 Simple, clean GUI using `tkinter`

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- `numpy` for signal math
- `matplotlib` for plotting
- `sounddevice` for audio playback
- `tkinter` for GUI (built-in, no installation needed)

## 🛣️ Future Plans

This project is just the beginning. In future phases, I plan to:

- [ ] Add triangle and sawtooth wave generation
- [ ] Replace text inputs with real-time sliders
- [ ] Export signals to `.wav` files
- [ ] Import, play and visual signals from '.wav' files
- [ ] Implement real-time waveform animation
- [ ] Use `customtkinter` or `Dear PyGui` for a modern GUI look
- [ ] Package the app as a standalone executable (with PyInstaller)
- [ ] Add filtering & FFT visualization tools

---

## 🙌 Purpose

This project is part of my journey into signal processing, Python GUI development, and applied electrical engineering. It also serves as a hands-on way to sharpen skills in code structure, visualization, and user interaction.
